## Inspiration
While some university's are providing COVID-19 symptom trackers for their faculty, staff, and students, very few individuals use such tools. To motivate individuals to use such trackers, our app, Divoc gamifies the symptom tracking experience by marking milestones and giving users awards. By being more aware of both one's mental and physical health, Divoc hopes to do its part to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. 

## What it does
Our website helps users track their physical and mental health and rewards them for staying "on track". 

## How we built it
We created our application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript and hosted it on the Google Cloud Platform.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team had great difficulty deploying our project using Google Cloud. This was Mansiâ€™s first time collaborating with a hackathon team using VS Code and using their Live Share extension. Viviane and Mansi worked together to set up their environment and link their git commands to VS Code. We are grateful to the mentors that helped us with our challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
All features of our website (buttons, images, etc) can be viewed on different browsers.
We are proud of the logo Mansi designed in Adobe Illustrator for our project. 

## What we learned
We learned how to deploy our project using Google Cloud, collaborate virtually, and use a Kanban board to stay organized. 

## What's next for Divoc
We hope to add more awards and milestones, to enable user's to develop their own trackers, and to learn more about how gamification can encourage users to engage with apps like ours.
